These goal of these notebook is to find clusters with K-Means machine learning in Toronto neighbourhoods. The names of the Toronto neighbourhoods are sourced from the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M" target="_blank">List of postal codes of Canada: M</a> with web scraping. The geolocator API delivers the geospatial data (longitude, latitudes) and Foursquare provides information about the neighborhoods using the longitude and latitude coordinates.
